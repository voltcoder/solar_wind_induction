#  Highway Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) – MATLAB/Simulink Simulation

##  Description
This project presents the modeling and simulation of a **Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)** designed for **installation in the middle of highways**. The turbine captures wind energy generated by moving vehicles and converts it into electrical power using a **Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG)**.

The system is developed in **MATLAB/Simulink** and focuses on analyzing the **mechanical and electrical performance** of a highway-based wind energy generation setup.
